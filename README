TIDY CC2540 SIMPLEBLEPERIPHERAL EXAMPLE

Disclaimer: This worked with the version 1.4.0 of CC2540/41 Bluetooth Low Energy SDK. In 1.4.1 there should be some issues I didn't bother to fix and I just copied 1.4.0 files instead.

Texas Instruments' way to diagram and order things sucks. You originally can't take out the project from the Projects folder, so in order to make it more portable and editable, I had
to adjust this a bit, separating the files you may edit and the common libraries.

This is just a rearranged copy of the SimpleBLEPeripheral project you should have when you download the BLE Stack in the Texas Instruments main page (www.ti.com)

You must abide to the license in the source code files in order to use this project (this is not my fault, I just don't want to get sued just for sharing two hours of work)

INSTRUCTIONS
If your BLE Stack installation folder is not "C:\Texas Instruments\BLE-CC254x-1.4.1.43908a", open TriplePeripheral.ewp file with your favourite text editor (it's an XML file) and replace this route with
the route where you have Texas BLE Stack installed.

Open with IAR Embedded Workbench for 8051 the workspace "TriplePeripheral.eww", and the program should compile and link nicely as it is.

Edit as you wish.
